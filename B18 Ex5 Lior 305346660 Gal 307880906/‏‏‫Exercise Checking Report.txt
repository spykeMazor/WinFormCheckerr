 Comments..............: In the exercise description we were asked to use a messageBox methods to display 
			messages for different kind of events, we used those methods as necessary to show 
			knowledge at the subject but also we created our own "custom" messageBox for other
			events.
			Graphical additions added:
			* We build a richer LOGIN form whith background and images to present player color.
			* We used PictureBox instead of Buttons to present the UI game board.
			* The PictureBox we used is called PictureBoxInTheBoard that inharinted from
			   PictureBox objct.
			* We add an option to change the background of the form.
			* In our form design we present the score on the right side instead the top of the form.
			* We don't autosize the form size because of our different design but 
			  we center the board according to the size.
